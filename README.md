# Deep Echo State Network Python library (DeepESNpy), 2018

Deep Echo State Network (DeepESN) is an extension of the ESN model towards the deep learning paradigm (Deep Reservoir Computing). A DeepESN is a deep Recurrent Neural Network composed by a hierarchy of recurrent layers intrinsically able to develop hierarchical and distributed temporal features. Such characteristics make DeepESN suitable for time-series and sequences processing.

All details about DeepESN model are described in the reference paper (**CITATION REQUEST**): <br />
